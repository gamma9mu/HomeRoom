HomeRoom is a web-based user interface, a resource aggregator and a RDF-based
content tagging system to support the delivery of learning objects tailored to

friendly interface to the user and gathering individual resources to compose
into a complete learning module.

HomeRoom is written in C# and uses ASP.NET for the web frontend.  The project
requires AjaxControlToolkit, which may be installed using NuGet.
